	<p><font color="white" size="5">We are a group of university students who always have difficulties in deciding what to have for our next meal and we believe we are not the only ones out there who face this tremendous daily challenge. Due to this fact, we have decided to go on a mission in trying to solve this problem not only for ourselves, but also for our fellow friends in college and university. After our constant efforts in trying to develop a solution, we have come up with this website where anyone can give reviews and suggest restaurants in Taylorâ€™s University Lakeside Campus based on their own personal experiences. With this website, students can have a reliable source to refer to when it comes to deciding which restaurant to have their next meal at based on their personal preferences.</font></p>
